# Unofficial Africa's Talking Golang API Wrapper  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go)
The wrapper provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written in server-side Golang. This is Work in Progress

## Installing
You can install any of the packages as shown below:

### Sms
```sh
go get github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/sms
```

### Airtime
```sh
go get github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/airtime
```

### Account
```sh
go get github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/account
```

### Payment
```sh
go get github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/payment
```

### Tokens
```sh
go get github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/token
```

### Demo
In order to run the demo, export the the following values to your environment. They can be found/generated at the Africa's Talking Dashboard.

``` sh
export AT_APIKEY=Your-AfricasTalking-API-KEY
export AT_USERNAME=Your-AfricasTalking-APP-USERNAME
export AT_SHORTCODE=Your-AfricasTalking-APP-Shortcode
```

That's all's that required. Assuming its a sandbox app, here's to run the demo:

``` sh
cd demo
go run main.go -e sandbox -m "Hello gopher!" -r "+254700000000"
```

### Usage
The package needs to be configured with your app username and API key (which you can get from the dashboard). You can also declare if you are running in production or in sandbox.

```golang
const (
	apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"		    //Production or Sandbox API Key
	username = "YOUR_USERNAME"	    //Your Africa's Talking Username
	env = ""		                // Choose either sandbox or production
)
```

### Creating the Gateway
We first need to create a Gateway using the constants declared above. We will use this Gateway to invoke Africa's Talking Services - SMS, Voice, Airtime, USSD.

This is how we create the Gateway in our code:

```golang
smsService := sms.NewService(username, apiKey, env)
```

### SMS 
When sending a message, you need to pass the following data:
* **Recipient(s)** 
* **Message** 

We invoke this function using the following code -  You can declare recipient and message as variables for code neatness:

```golang
//Send SMS - REPLACE Recipient and Message with REAL Values
smsResponse, err := smsService.Send("Recipient", "Message To Send", "")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
}

fmt.Println(smsResponse)
```

This is the complete sample code. Try to understand how this works first!!!
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/AndroidStudyOpenSource/africastalking-go/sms"
)

const (
	username = "" // Choose either Sandbox for test or Your Africa's Talking Username for production
	apiKey   = "" //Production or Sandbox API Key
	env   = "" // Choose either sandbox or production
)

func main() {
	//Call the Gateway, and pass the constants here!
	smsService := sms.NewService(username, apiKey, env)

	//Send SMS - REPLACE Recipient and Message To Send with REAL Values
	//Leave ShortCode blank, "", if you don't have one
	smsResponse, err := smsService.Send("ShortCode", "Recipient", "Message To Send")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(smsResponse)
}

```
You can easily test this using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) Clients!
